# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
This section was less difficult for me than the past few sections. I'm still struggling with syntax but feel like I have a good grasp on all of the concepts. 
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
Note taking is going well. I have a set of highlighters that are all different colors so I'm color coding definitions, code, etc. This is especially helpful when I need to find code from a previous lesson and it's already highlighted pink. 
- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
Trying to solve the problem on my own referencing notes and examples. Googling and using MDN web docs is really helpful, however I can fall into a Google spiral pretty easily which is why I like to try on my own using my notes first.
